The goal of this plugin is to allow you to make modifications to .ush and .usf files that come with unreal engine.
It does so in a way which does not require editing engine source code and is completely portable.
That being said, it is still in its early stages, and there is a lot of room for improvements.

An example of how to use it can be found in my [Advanced Tonemapping Plugin](https://github.com/kriNon/AdvancedTonemappingUnrealPlugin/tree/main).
